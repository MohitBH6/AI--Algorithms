# 8-Puzzle Problem Solvers (AI Lab)

This repository contains implementations of the **8-Puzzle problem** using different AI search algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Best-First Search (Heuristic based)**
- **Hill Climbing**

---

📘 Explanation

BFS (Breadth First Search): Explores all nodes level by level. Guarantees shortest solution but slow for large puzzles.

DFS (Depth First Search): Explores as deep as possible first. Might get stuck in long paths.

Best-First Search: Uses a heuristic (number of misplaced tiles) to guide search.

Hill Climbing: Greedy search that tries to minimize heuristic step by step, may get stuck in local minima.

Start State:

1 2 3

4 0 6
